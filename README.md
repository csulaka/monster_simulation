# Remark (10/23/2018):
   1. modified the randomNumber in index.js, it will get randNum based on the combined.json size
   2. module export from getNewJSON.js
   3. Bugs: can not create combined.json if run directly from index.js (need to debug) 
         note: if combined.json is not exists, may need to use "node getNewJSON.js" to create the json file and data
   4. use "node index.js" to start server
